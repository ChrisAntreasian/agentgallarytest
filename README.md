# Agent Test Gallery

This project is a collection of various interactive web pages and components, primarily used for testing and demonstration purposes with AI agents. Each directory within `src/app` typically represents a distinct test page or feature.

## Pages Overview

*   `/` (Root Page - `src/app/page.js`)**: The main landing page of the application.
*   `/checkers`: A checkers game implementation.
*   `/cube`: A 3D rotating cube demonstration. (Note: Also contains `checkers.module.css`, which might be related to an earlier test or integration).
*   `/drawing-app`: A simple drawing application.
*   `/game`: A generic game page (content to be defined).
*   `/hiHo`: A simple page displaying "Hello Github my agent put this here" and some dummy text.
*   `/hypercube`: A 3D rotating hypercube (tesseract) demonstration.
*   `/roots`: A page likely demonstrating a tree-like structure or fractal generation (contains `Controls.js` and `Tree.js`).
*   `/silly-cat`: A page placeholder, content to be defined. (Directory name is "silly cat")
*   `/todo`: A to-do list application.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
